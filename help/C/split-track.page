  <title>Split an audio track</title>

  <p>You can split a single audio track into multiple tracks when you put
  together an audio project.</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Start an audio project and add the tracks you wish to use.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select the track you wish to split by clicking on it, then click either
      <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Split Track…</gui></guiseq> or right click on
      the track and select <gui>Split Track…</gui> from the menu.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select your preferred method of splitting the tracks, and split at the
      points where you want one to end and the next one to begin.</p>
      <note>
        <p>If you try to split a track into a section less than six seconds
        long, the new section will be padded to make it 6 seconds long. <!--If
        you try to split a track which is under six seconds long in
        <app>Brasero</app> version 3.0.0, the track spliter will not work.--></p>
      </note>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click <gui>OK</gui> to confirm your track splits and apply the changes.</p>
      <note>
        <p>You can split and merge the same track as many times as you like,
        while you are viewing the split track dialog. Once you confirm your
        track splitting by clicking <gui>OK</gui>, you will no longer be able to
        merge the sections you have already split off. To revert the changes,
        remove the split sections of the track from your project and re-add the
        track.</p>
